# B12X MX-FP6: making and serving FP6 quants

End-to-end guide: how to produce an MX-FP6 checkpoint from a BF16 HF model,
and how to serve it with B12X + nightly vLLM. Reference numbers
(classification, KLD, performance) live in `fp6-results.md`; kernel-level
format details in `mxfp6-w6a8.md`; plugin internals in
`mxfp6-vllm-integration.md`.

Requirements: NVIDIA Blackwell GPU (sm_120 validated; the GEMM uses the
block-scaled `mxf8f6f4` MMA), CUDA 13 stack, Python >= 3.12.

---

## 1. Making an FP6 quant

### 1.1 The converter

One script handles both dense and MoE models:

```bash
python scripts/quantize_model_fp6.py \
  --model /path/to/bf16-hf-model \
  --out   /path/to/output-fp6 \
  --arch  auto
```

It walks the HF checkpoint (`config.json` + `*.safetensors`), quantizes the
eligible 2-D Linear weights to packed MX-FP6 (E2M3, 6-bit codes + UE8M0
block scale per 32 values), and writes a full loadable HF checkpoint:
sharded `model-*.safetensors` + index, a patched `config.json` carrying
`quantization_config = {"quant_method": "modelopt", "quant_algo": "W6A6"}`
with ModelOpt-mirror tensor keys (`.weight` / `.weight_scale` /
`.weight_scale_2` / `.input_scale`), and copies of the tokenizer/chat
template files. Routed MoE experts are written per-expert.

**What gets quantized (the "golden rule" walk):** MLP projections,
attention q/k/v/o, MoE routed experts (gate/up/down) and the shared expert.
**Kept BF16:** norms, embeddings, router gates, `lm_head`, the MTP head,
linear-attention (SSM/DeltaNet) projections and the vision tower — the last
two can be opted in (below). Exclusions are recorded in
`quantization_config.exclude_modules`.

Preview what a run will do without writing anything:

```bash
python scripts/quantize_model_fp6.py --model <dir> --out /tmp/x --arch auto --dry-run
```

### 1.2 Quant-time knobs

| Flag | Default | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `--arch {auto,moe,dense}` | `auto` | Model family; `auto` detects routed experts from the checkpoint. |
| `--source-format` | `mxfp6_w6a8` | Weight/activation format pairing. `mxfp6_w6a8`: E2M3 weights + FP8 E4M3 *runtime* activations (best KLD, the validated default). `mxfp6_default`: E2M3 + E3M2 activations (legacy true-W6A6). `mxfp6_e2m3` / `mxfp6_e3m2`: symmetric pairings. |
| `--block-scale-rule {mse,ceil}` | `mse` | UE8M0 weight block-exponent selection. `mse` tries per-block ceil vs ceil-1 and keeps the lower error; `ceil` is amax containment only. Weights only — runtime activation quant is unaffected. |
| `--no-attention` | off | Skip attention q/k/v/o (weight-only MLP/expert quant). |
| `--include-linear-attn` | off | Also quantize linear-attention (DeltaNet/SSM) `in_proj_*`/`out_proj` matmuls. Shrinks hybrid multimodal checkpoints below FP8 size; quality trade-off — validate KLD downstream. (The published Qwen3.6-27B "`_la`" build uses this.) |
| `--include-vision` | off | Also quantize vision-tower block linears. |
| `--activation {silu,relu2}` | `silu` | MoE only: expert activation function baked into the fused kernel selection. |
| `--gate-up-order {gate_up,up_gate}` | `gate_up` | MoE only: row order of the source fused FC1 weight. |
| `--skip-experts` | off | MoE sensitivity diagnostic: keep routed experts BF16, quantize everything else. Not for production. |
| `--skip-shared-expert` | off | MoE sensitivity diagnostic: keep shared-expert linears BF16. |
| `--report-error` | off | Dequantize every emitted tensor and print a per-group relative-RMSE table (experts gate/up/down, shared_expert, self_attn, linear_attn, ...). |
| `--limit-layers N` | all | Convert only the first N layers (bring-up/testing). |
| `--no-gpu` | off | MoE only: slow torch reference quantizer instead of the GPU path. |
| `--format {safetensors,pt}` | `safetensors` | `safetensors` = full HF checkpoint (what vLLM serves). `pt` = per-layer kernel-validation artifacts (name is historical — output is still safetensors; pickle is never used). |
| `--inspect LAYER` | — | Print every checkpoint key + shape under `.layers.{LAYER}.` and exit. |
| `--dry-run` | off | Print the conversion plan; write nothing. |

Practical guidance: leave `--source-format` and `--block-scale-rule` at
their defaults — `mxfp6_w6a8` + `mse` is the combination all published KLD
numbers were measured with. The knobs that meaningfully change the
size/quality trade are `--include-linear-attn` and `--include-vision`; use
`--report-error` and a downstream KLD run to judge them per model.

## 2. Serving with B12X + nightly vLLM

### 2.1 Install (serving venv — KLD scoring uses its own venv, see §2.6)

vLLM nightly pins its own torch; b12x declares `torch>=2.12`. Keep
the venv on **vLLM's pinned stack** and install b12x with
`--no-deps` so it cannot upgrade torch out from under vLLM's precompiled
binaries:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

# 1. torch stack (cu130) at vLLM's pin:
uv pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130 \
  torch==2.11.0 torchvision==0.26.0 torchaudio==2.11.0

# 2. nightly vLLM from source with precompiled kernels:
cd vllm && VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1 uv pip install -e . && cd ..

# 3. b12x — --no-deps is MANDATORY (see above):
uv pip install -e /path/to/b12x --no-deps

python -c "import torchvision, vllm, b12x; print('stack OK')"
```

If torch 2.13.x ever appears in an install log, the pin was broken —
re-run steps 1-3 in order.

Installing b12x registers the vLLM plugin automatically via the
`vllm.general_plugins` entry point
(`b12x.integration.vllm.plugin:register_b12x_fp6`); it runs in
every vLLM process (front end, engine core, TP workers). `b12x_fp6`
is **not** a stock vLLM quant method — without the package installed,
`--quantization b12x_fp6` will not resolve.

### 2.2 Environment gates

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `B12X_ENABLE_FP6=1` | Master gate. Unset/0 = the plugin stays inert and vLLM uses its native paths. |
| `B12X_FP6_MODEL_DIR=<checkpoint dir>` | Where the plugin indexes FP6 tensors. Export **unconditionally** per launch: a stale value from a previous launch mis-classifies layers and trips loader shape asserts. |
| `B12X_ENABLE_FP6_MICRO=0` | Keep the fast fused dense kernel (the BS1 micro kernel is slower for these workloads). |
| `B12X_DENSE_PER_ROW_IN_KERNEL` | Default `1`: compute per-row activation scaling in the small-M quantizer and the large-M row-scale/TMA path. `0` uses the equivalent host-side chain. |
| `B12X_DENSE_PERSISTENT_SCRATCH` | Default `1`: retain stream-local quantization workspaces. CUDA-graph capture requires a sufficiently sized eager workspace prewarmed for each capture stream and fails instead of allocating during capture. |

Never leak KLD-scoring-only variables into serving: unset
`TORCH_COMPILE_DISABLE` and `B12X_DYNAMIC_DETERMINISTIC_OUTPUT`
(the launch scripts below do this).

### 2.3 Minimal launch

```bash
export B12X_ENABLE_FP6=1
export B12X_FP6_MODEL_DIR=/path/to/fp6-checkpoint

vllm serve /path/to/fp6-checkpoint \
  --quantization b12x_fp6 \
  --served-model-name my-model-fp6 \
  --trust-remote-code
```

`--quantization b12x_fp6` is optional — the plugin claims any
checkpoint whose `config.json` carries `quant_method=modelopt` +
`quant_algo=W6A6` when the enable gate is set. At TP>1 on Blackwell add
`--disable-custom-all-reduce` (vLLM's custom all-reduce kernel crashes
during CUDA-graph capture on sm_120; the NCCL fallback costs ~1-3%).

Verify the server end to end:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:8001/v1/models
```

The production launch scripts below encode all of the hard-won defaults
(MTP speculative config, CUDA-graph capture sizes synced to the MTP verify
batch, vision toggles, profiler hooks) and are the recommended starting
point.

### 2.4 Example launch script — Qwen3.6-27B dense (TP=1/2)

Usage: `./qwen3.6-27b-fp6.sh API-KEY-HERE` (or `VLLM_API_KEY=... ./qwen3.6-27b-fp6.sh`).
Override any `${VAR:-default}` at launch, e.g.
`MODEL_DIR=/path TP_SIZE=2 ./qwen3.6-27b-fp6.sh KEY`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

# ============================================================
#
# Model:
#   - Base:    Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B  (arch tag: qwen3_5, ~28B params)
#   - Quant:   B12X MX-FP6 (W6A6 schema tag): 6-bit weights on disk,
#              activations quantized at runtime to FP8 E4M3 (W6A8 execution).
#              quantization_config = {"quant_method":"modelopt","quant_algo":"W6A6"}
#              Golden-rule Linear coverage: MLP + full attention + linear_attn
#              projections quantized to FP6 (this is the "_la" build that drops
#              below the FP8 size). IGNORED / kept BF16: lm_head, visual tower,
#              mtp head, embeddings, router gates, norms.
#              Served by the B12X fused dense kernel (not the micro kernel).
#
# Architecture notes (from the upstream Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B card):
#   - Hybrid 64-layer stack:
#       16 x (3 x (Gated DeltaNet -> FFN) + 1 x (Gated Attention -> FFN))
#     i.e. 48 linear-attention (DeltaNet) layers + 16 full-attention layers.
#     KV cache is only allocated for the 16 Gated Attention layers.
#   - Gated Attention: 24 Q heads, 4 KV heads, head_dim=256, partial RoPE.
#   - Gated DeltaNet: 48 V heads, 16 QK heads, head_dim=128 (no KV cache).
#   - Vision encoder present (VL model); MTP head trained-in.
#   - Native ctx: 262,144 tokens (so 131,072 here needs no YaRN override).
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# PREREQUISITE -- register the B12X FP6 quantization in vLLM
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#   "b12x_fp6" is NOT a stock vLLM quant method. vLLM's native ModelOpt
#   path does not implement W6A6, so the b12x package must be installed
#   in the serving venv: its "vllm.general_plugins" entry point
#   (b12x.integration.vllm.plugin:register_b12x_fp6) registers the
#   B12XFp6Config in every vLLM process (front, engine-core, TP workers).
#   Until then, `--quantization b12x_fp6` will not resolve.
#
#   The two env gates below are what the FP6 serving layer keys off of:
#     B12X_ENABLE_FP6=1        -> select the FP6 path (else native fallback)
#     B12X_ENABLE_FP6_MICRO=0  -> use the fast fused kernel, not the BS1
#                                       micro kernel (slower for this workload).
#
# VRAM fit on 1x 96 GiB Blackwell:
#   - FP6 weights for the quantized Linears (~16B params @ ~6.25 bit) plus the
#     BF16 residue (visual/lm_head/embeddings/mtp) resident ~= 26 GiB.
#   - KV cache (Gated Attention layers only, BF16, TP=1):
#       per-token KV = 16 layers * 2 (K+V) * 4 KV heads * 256 = 64 KiB/token
#       128K ctx, 1 seq = 8 GiB ; 4 seqs = 32 GiB
#   - 26 GiB weights + 32 GiB KV + graphs/vision still fits 96 GiB with margin.

### 2.5 Example launch script — Qwen3.6-35B-A3B MoE (TP=1/2)

Same usage pattern. MoE expert sharding works through vLLM's loader, and
TP=2 has been validated (the script adds `--disable-custom-all-reduce`
automatically at TP>1). At single-stream loads TP=2 buys capacity more
than latency (~8% TPOT gain; see `fp6-results.md` §3.4-3.5).

#   - Quant:   B12X MX-FP6 (W6A6 schema tag): 6-bit weights on disk,
#              activations quantized at runtime to FP8 E4M3 (W6A8 execution).
#              quantization_config = {"quant_method":"modelopt","quant_algo":"W6A6"}
#              Coverage: all 256 routed experts per layer (gate/up/down), the
#              shared expert, MLP + full attention + linear_attn projections.
#              IGNORED / kept BF16: lm_head, visual tower, mtp head, embeddings,
#              router gates (mlp.gate / shared_expert_gate), norms, GDN aux.
#              Routed experts run through the B12X fused MoE kernel
#              (FusedMoE binding); everything else uses the dense FP6 path.
#
# Architecture notes:
#   - 40-layer hybrid stack: 30 Gated DeltaNet (linear_attn) layers + 10 full
#     Gated Attention layers. KV cache only for the 10 full-attention layers.
#   - MoE: 256 routed experts, top-8, + 1 shared expert per layer.
#     Expert dims 2048 (hidden) -> 512 (intermediate).
#   - Vision encoder present (VL model); MTP head trained-in (kept BF16).

# PREREQUISITE -- register the B12X FP6 quantization in vLLM

#   "b12x_fp6" is NOT a stock vLLM quant method; the b12x package
#   (b12x.integration.vllm.plugin, wired via the vllm.general_plugins
#   entry point in b12x's pyproject) must be installed in the serving
#   venv. The env gates:
#     B12X_ENABLE_FP6=1        -> select the FP6 path (else native fallback)
#     B12X_ENABLE_FP6_MICRO=0  -> dense linears use the fused kernel. The
#                                       MoE expert path picks its own backend
#                                       per shape.
#
# VRAM fit on 1x 96 GiB Blackwell:
#   - FP6 checkpoint is ~28.8 GiB on disk; plus BF16 residue (visual/lm_head/
#     embeddings/mtp/router) resident ~= 32 GiB.
#   - KV cache only for the 10 Gated Attention layers -> 128K context is cheap
#     relative to the dense 27B build.

### 2.6 Validating a quant (KLD scoring)

The KLD scorer (`examples/offline_inference/score_mode_kld.py`) is **not**
part of upstream vLLM — it lives on the feature branch
[`phaelon74/vllm@feature/score-mode-ppl-kld`](https://github.com/phaelon74/vllm/tree/feature/score-mode-ppl-kld),
an off-branch from vLLM main. Because it diverges from the nightly you
serve with, install it in its **own dedicated venv** — do not mix it into
the serving venv from §2.1:

```bash
git clone -b feature/score-mode-ppl-kld https://github.com/phaelon74/vllm.git vllm-kld
python3.12 -m venv venv-kld && source venv-kld/bin/activate

# Same torch pin + install order as §2.1, inside THIS venv:
uv pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130 \
  torch==2.11.0 torchvision==0.26.0 torchaudio==2.11.0
cd vllm-kld && VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1 uv pip install -e . && cd ..
uv pip install -e /path/to/b12x --no-deps
```

Scoring runs offline (not against a server) with deterministic eager
execution, from the `vllm-kld` checkout with `venv-kld` active:

```bash
export B12X_ENABLE_FP6=1
export B12X_FP6_MODEL_DIR=/path/to/fp6-checkpoint
export VLLM_WORKER_MULTIPROC_METHOD=spawn
export TORCH_COMPILE_DISABLE=1   # mandatory for reproducible KLD

python examples/offline_inference/score_mode_kld.py \
  --model "$B12X_FP6_MODEL_DIR" \
  --reference-logits /path/to/ref_logits_<base>_ctx2048_s512 \
  --dataset wikitext --dataset-config wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
  --context-length 2048 --stride 512 \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.90
```

The mean KLD is bit-deterministic under this configuration: run it twice
and expect the identical value (any difference is a bug). Reference values
for the validated models are in `fp6-results.md`. `TORCH_COMPILE_DISABLE`
is for scoring only — never leave it set when serving (the launch scripts
unset it).

### 2.7 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `--quantization b12x_fp6` "invalid choice" | b12x not installed in the serving venv; the plugin entry point never ran. |
| Loader `AssertionError` in `vllm/model_executor/parameter.py` | `B12X_FP6_MODEL_DIR` points at a different checkpoint than the one being served (stale export). Export it unconditionally per launch. |
| `torchvision::nms` missing after installing b12x | torch got upgraded past vLLM's pin — reinstall per §2.1 (b12x with `--no-deps`). |
| CUDA error `custom_all_reduce.cuh ... invalid argument` at TP>1 | Blackwell sm_120 custom all-reduce vs CUDA graphs; pass `--disable-custom-all-reduce` (scripts do it automatically). |
| `--speculative-config ... cannot be converted` | JSON default embedded in `${VAR:-...}` — bash truncates at the first `}`. Assign JSON via a plain `if [[ -z ... ]]` block (scripts already do). |
| Mamba/DeltaNet cudagraph cache assert during MTP capture | Set `MAX_CUDAGRAPH_CAPTURE_SIZE=4` (or 1), or `ENABLE_MTP=0` to isolate. |
| `pytest` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: torch` | The system pytest resolved instead of the venv's; run `python -m pytest`. |
