# BTX checkpoint format

BTX (b12x trellis exchange) is the checkpoint container for trellis-coded
MoE expert weights. Its defining property is tensor-parallel shard
independence: one stored artifact serves every TP degree, and a rank loads
exactly its slice without decoding or re-encoding any trellis symbol. Its
second property is that the container is declarative: codebook, rate
structure, coupled-Hadamard transform, and geometry are metadata, and the
reader derives all byte addressing from those declarations. There are no
named profiles and no arithmetic conventions baked into reader code.

Storage schema id: `btx-atoms-v1`. The in-repo schema implementation is
`b12x/moe/_shared/btx_schema.py`.

## Concepts

**Atom slot.** Weights are quantized as `trellis_t256` tiles over the
model's global intermediate axis. That axis is divided into 32-channel
*atom slots*; a slot is the resharding grain. Every per-channel datum a
rank needs is stored slot-major, so a rank extent — a contiguous, aligned
range of slots — is a row-range read of each tensor.

**Codebook.** The trellis decode law is a model-level setting, one of
`mcg`, `sqg_e4m3`, or `sqg_fp16` (registry:
`b12x/moe/_shared/trellis_codebooks.py`). The container's payload bytes are
codebook-agnostic; the manifest names the interpretation.

**Rate structure.** Either `uniform` — one bitrate K2..K6 for the whole
model — or `per_expert_pair` — an explicit rate byte per (256-channel
pair, expert), stored as tensors. A rate byte is
`(low_bits << 4) | high_bits` and maps one-to-one onto the fused kernel's
pair-kind vocabulary (`0x33` = P33, `0x24` = P24, `0x43` = P43, `0x44` =
P44, `0x22` = P22). There is no finer granularity: the fused decoder's
intra-pair low/high plane split is exactly one rate byte.

**Coupled Hadamard.** An optional exact activation-boundary
reparameterization: a residual Hadamard of declared `pre_block` width and
pre/post-activation Hadamards of declared `post_block` width, with one
frozen Rademacher draw per expert stored as data.

```

## Manifest

`btx-manifest.json` is a single JSON object. Validation is fail-closed:
unknown keys are rejected, and every cross-field consistency rule below is
enforced before any tensor is read.

| field | contents |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `"btx-manifest"` |
| `schema` | `"btx-atoms-v1"` |
| `codebook` | `"mcg"` \| `"sqg_e4m3"` \| `"sqg_fp16"` |
| `codebook_seed` | required iff `mcg`: the MCG multiplier `0xCBAC1FED` as an integer; forbidden otherwise |
| `geometry.num_experts` | experts per MoE layer |
| `geometry.hidden_size` | hidden width, multiple of 16 |
| `geometry.intermediate_size` | global (pre-TP) intermediate width |
| `geometry.atom_channels` | `32` |
| `geometry.atom_slots` | `intermediate_size / atom_channels` (validated) |
| `geometry.moe_layer_indices` | explicit list of the MoE layer indices |
| `rates.structure` | `"uniform"` \| `"per_expert_pair"` |
| `rates.bits` | uniform only: 2..6, within the codebook's range |
| `rates.pair_kinds` | per_expert_pair only: the exact set of pair kinds the tables use |
| `hadamard.coupled` | boolean |
| `hadamard.pre_block` / `post_block` | coupled only: block widths, multiples of 32; `intermediate_size % post_block == 0` |
| `hadamard.per_expert_input_rotations` | `[E,H]` suh/svh tables vs `[H]` broadcast |
| `layout.atom_row_alignment` | row stride alignment of `atoms` (bytes) |
| `layout.extent_alignment_slots` | legal slice granularity in slots |
| `layout.extent_barriers` | slot indices no rank extent may cross |
| `layers` | map of layer index → `{file, sha256}` |

Codebook bit ranges: `sqg_e4m3` K2–K4, `sqg_fp16` K5–K6, `mcg` K3–K6.

## Per-layer tensors

Each `btx-layer-<NNNNN>.safetensors` contains exactly the tensors its
declarations call for. The safetensors metadata echoes the manifest
identity (`schema`, `codebook`, `layer`, geometry) and the reader rejects
any disagreement.

| tensor | dtype / shape | presence |
|---|---|---|
| `atoms` | u8 `[atom_slots, row_stride]` | always |
| `rotations` | fp16 `[atom_slots, num_experts, 3, atom_channels]` | always |
| `rates_fc1`, `rates_fc2` | u8 `[atom_slots/8, num_experts]` | iff `per_expert_pair` |
| `gate_suh`, `up_suh`, `down_svh` | fp16 `[hidden_size]` or `[num_experts, hidden_size]` | always |
| `rotation_draws` | u8 `[num_experts]`, values 0..7 | iff coupled |

`rotations` holds the intermediate-boundary incoherence values (gate svh,
up svh, down suh) for each slot's 32 channels in physical channel order,
for every rate structure. `gate_suh`/`up_suh`/`down_svh` hold the
hidden-axis values; their shape matches
`hadamard.per_expert_input_rotations`.

## `atoms` payload layout

Row `r` of `atoms` covers atom slot `r`. Within a row, expert bundles are
concatenated in expert-id order, followed by zero padding to the row
stride; the stride is a multiple of `layout.atom_row_alignment`, and any
non-zero byte in the padding is rejected.

One bundle holds the trellis code words slot `r` contributes to one
expert: gate ‖ up ‖ down. Each matrix section stores its low-record plane
followed by its high-record plane, each plane K-major:
`[hidden_size/16][16*low_bits]i16 ‖ [hidden_size/16][16*high_bits]i16`.

- Under `per_expert_pair`, the planes are the atom's tile in the pair's
  low-rate 128-channel record and its tile in the high-rate record, and
  `(low_bits, high_bits)` come from the expert's rate byte for the pair
  containing slot `r`.
- Under `uniform`, records do not exist; the two planes are the atom's two
  consecutive N16 (FC1) or K16 (FC2) tiles at the declared bitrate.

Section sizes are pure functions of the declarations
(`btx_schema.matrix_atom_bytes` / `btx_schema.bundle_bytes`):

```
matrix_atom_bytes = (hidden_size / 16) * 32 * (low_bits + high_bits)
bundle_bytes      = 3 * matrix_atom_bytes            # equal-rate matrices
```

Bundle offsets within a row follow from prefix sums over the rate tables
(uniform rows have constant bundles). Nothing else about the layout is
implicit: there is no expert reordering by rate class, no rotation of
logical pairs across physical slots, and no embedded scale or format
sections.

## Rank extents

A rank owns the slot range `[first_slot, first_slot + slot_count)`. The
range must align to `layout.extent_alignment_slots` and must not cross any
`layout.extent_barriers` entry. The writer declares those values from what
the payload's transforms require — pair-decoded rates need whole
256-channel pairs (8 slots); blockwise intermediate rotations need whole
rotation blocks; a coupled pre-activation transform whose halves must not
split contributes a barrier. The reader enforces the declarations without
knowing the reasons.

A rank shorter than the serving kernel's minimum local width is padded at
preparation time, exactly as any other legal extent.

## Support status

- **Production**: uniform rate structures across the codebook bit ranges
  (K2–K6), coupled and uncoupled, on the fused W4A16 serving path. The
  qualified production deployment is uniform coupled K2 with `sqg_e4m3`.
- **Supported, non-production**: `per_expert_pair` rate structures. A
  declared pair-kind set of `{P33, P43}` or `{P33, P24}` (with the
  kernel's bits-3 base specialization) executes through the fused kernel's
  expert-static dynamic dispatch.
- **Declared, unfused**: pair-kind sets containing `P44` (whole-expert K4
  tiers mixed with K3 experts). The container expresses them; single-launch
  fused execution has no dynamic P44 arm, so planning fails closed with a
  status message. Two serial launches or the mixed-tier benchmark kernel
  (`b12x/moe/_shared/kernels/w4a16/mixed_trellis.py`) are the execution
  vehicles.
- A `per_expert_pair` checkpoint is TP-degree-sensitive on FC2: the fused
  kernel's K-axis pair decode requires a 256-channel local intermediate,
  so some legal checkpoints are unservable at a given TP degree; planning
  reports this fail-closed.
