"""Native Spark/TP2 compact pipeline consuming the existing FP8 K32 wire rows.

The signature matches V41SlicePipeline so the native expert ABI is unchanged.
Only intermediate, projections and FP32 route output require scratch. Native
outer scales are compile-time ones: capacity variants share and overwrite the
same arena, so no persistent initialized constant may be read from scratch.
