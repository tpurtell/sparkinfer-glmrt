"""Grouped-selector sparse GQA for the Qwen3.8-Flash-Next QSA contract.

QSA keeps exact, original-token BF16 or globally scaled FP8 E4M3 GQA K/V and
uses a second compressed BF16 key cache only to select groups of logical token
positions. The public lifecycle is ``Caps -> plan -> bind -> prewarm -> run``.
Planning owns split and scratch policy; binding validates tensors and creates
references without allocating tensors. Optional stream scheduling creates a
completion event at bind time. ``prewarm`` compiles both request-ID widths and
both sparse-GQA row regimes without reading or mutating cache state and may be
omitted when first-use JIT latency is acceptable.

``run`` executes the decode transaction through opaque mutating dispatcher
operations and never dispatches the slow functions in
:mod:`b12x.attention.qsa.reference`.  The bound main K/V cache and both page
tables are read-only.  The bound output, selected-position matrix, compressed
selector cache, and raw selector state are mutable.  The caller writes the
live original-token K/V on the calling stream before ``run``; QSA has no main-cache writer.

An optional ``selection_stream`` on the binding lets ``run`` overlap selection
with main Q/K/V production. The caller records ``index_ready`` after producing
all selector inputs and metadata, before enqueuing independent main Q/K/V
work. QSA joins selection before attention on the calling stream. Streams and
synchronization resources are established before graph capture.

For overlapped execution, create resources and prewarm before capture::

    selection_stream = torch.cuda.Stream(device=caps.device)
    index_ready = torch.cuda.Event()
    binding = qsa.bind(plan, **buffers, selection_stream=selection_stream)
    qsa.prewarm(binding)

The caller's launch sequence, also used inside CUDA graph capture, is::

    produce_selector_inputs_and_metadata()
    index_ready.record()  # Includes prior writes to bound selector state.
    produce_main_query_and_write_kv()
    output = qsa.run(binding, **inputs, index_ready=index_ready)

The producer names denote caller operations; QSA does not own projection or
main-cache writes. ``inputs`` contains the same query, index projections and
request metadata as serial ``run``. Compiled producers that mutate caller
buffers must expose their writes at the event boundary; deferring writes to a
compiler epilogue cannot establish producer readiness.

Raw selector state is indexed by persistent state slots, not batch indices.
``request_ids[row]`` selects a batch entry and ``raw_state_slot_ids[batch]``
selects its persistent slot; ``-1`` denotes padded work and forbids mutation.
Before assigning a fresh or recycled slot, the caller must fill its logical
and RoPE-position metadata with ``-1``.  Raw-key payload bytes need no
initialization because a key is readable only when its logical-position tag
matches the requested token.  A physical raw page stores the BF16 key payload
first, followed by bit-preserving int64 logical-position tags and RoPE
coordinates in the reserved tail.  ``cache_requirements`` reports whether the
complete raw page fits in one compressed-cache page; ``bind`` enforces that
condition only when the cache manager aliases their allocation slots.

When compressed and raw state share backing pages, every cached request keeps
owning its pages even while it has no rows in the current packed decode call.
Until eviction, the caller must retain that request's valid
``sequence_lengths``, ``compressed_block_table`` entries, and
``raw_state_slot_ids`` mapping.  Zero sequence lengths and ``-1`` table or slot
entries are reserved for unused or evicted capacity, not merely inactive
cached requests.

At the prefill-to-decode handoff for a first decode interval beginning at
logical position ``N``, the state-slot anchor is
``N - num_accepted_tokens``.  The raw ring must contain exact tagged raw keys
and RoPE positions for the trailing incomplete compression group; a decode row
that closes that group consumes the prefill state before overwriting the ring.
The ``-1`` anchor is reserved for initializing position zero with one accepted
token.

Bound cosine and sine tables accept positive-row-stride, unit-inner-stride
views, so the two halves of a combined RoPE table require no copies.  Dynamic
RoPE positions accept non-overlapping positive-stride views, including the
transpose of a native ``[axes, rows]`` MRoPE tensor.

Selected positions are request-relative original-token positions.  Every row
has fixed width ``budget + compress_ratio - 1``; valid positions are packed
first and unused entries are ``-1``.  Completed groups are expanded in their
selected order, followed by the causally visible incomplete-group tail.
The selected-position reader supports widths of at least 2051. Width is a
planned specialization; changing live rows preserves the warmed callable
within each split or direct reader regime.

Draft layers may bind persistent selection anchors for reuse within one MTP
round. B12X describes the layout; the caller allocates the storage::

    anchor_plan = plan.draft_selection_plan()
    anchor_storage = {
        spec.name: torch.empty(spec.shape, dtype=spec.dtype, device=spec.device)
        for spec in anchor_plan.storage_specs()
    }
    anchors = anchor_plan.bind(storage=anchor_storage)
    anchors.reset()
    binding = qsa.bind(plan, **buffers, draft_selection=anchors)

``buffers`` includes the caller allocations required by ``plan.scratch_specs``
and the ordinary cache, output, and selected-position buffers. Temporary
anchor-gather and causal-tail buffers are included in that scratch contract.
Binding creates views without allocating or initializing tensor storage.
Prewarm preserves anchors and allocates only its synthetic warmup inputs.

An ordinary ``qsa.run(binding, **inputs)`` records an independent copy of the
selection, logical positions, error mask, and valid row count. Subsequent draft
steps supply a caller-owned int32/int64 vector mapping batch request IDs to
accepted rows of that recording::

    output = qsa.run(
        binding, query=query, request_ids=request_ids,
        query_positions=query_positions,
        reuse=qsa.DraftSelectionReuse(source_rows=accepted_rows),
    )

Reuse requires one query per request and omits selector inputs and
``index_ready``. It preserves anchors and selector caches, appends the causal
suffix bounded by ``max_speculative_tokens``, and poisons invalid active rows.
The caller must reset at round boundaries and request recycling, and map each
request to an anchor from the same request, model layer, and round. Bounds and
causal positions are checked; request identity and round provenance are not.
Returned anchor views are for inspection; ``reset`` and ``run`` own mutations.

Capacity variants of a layer's plan may share anchors when device, selection
width, and cache/request assignment match. Pass ``max_source_rows`` to
``draft_selection_plan`` to cover the largest recording plan. Each plan reports
its own scratch requirements. Order resets, recordings, map writes, and reuse
on the calling stream or join them with caller-owned events; keep all storage
alive through graph replay and do not overlap operations sharing mutable state.
