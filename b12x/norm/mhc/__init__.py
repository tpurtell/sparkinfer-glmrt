"""mHC residual for SM12x: fused RMSNorm + hyper-connection mixing +
projection (DeepSeek-style), BF16 with TF32 projection paths.

Three phases share one plan/binding; the phase is the verb because the
signatures differ: ``run_pre`` broadcasts a rank-2 residual into the four
lanes at model entry, ``run_post_pre`` is the steady-state fused post+pre
boundary between sublayers/layers, and ``run_post`` is the terminal mix-back.
``run_head`` performs the checkpoint's terminal four-lane sigmoid collapse and
RMSNorm, and can retain the pre-norm collapse in a second caller-owned output.
Sinkhorn-normalized mix matrices; hidden sizes 4096/5120/7168; mix
constants exposed as ``MIXES`` / ``MULT`` / ``PARTIALS``. A bound lifecycle
uses only caller-owned scratch and outputs.

V4.1 lagged input mixing: pass incoming FP32 ``pre_mix[tokens, 4]`` to
``run_pre`` or ``run_post_pre`` and a disjoint caller-owned FP32 ``pre_out``
(directly or at bind time). The incoming coefficients collapse this residual;
newly predicted coefficients are written to ``pre_out`` for the next sublayer.
The four returned tensors remain ``residual, post, comb, y``. Initialize the
first incoming mix to one-hot. With ``norm_weight`` and ``norm_eps=1e-20``,
RMSNorm follows the BF16-rounded collapse. Omitting both mix arguments keeps
the original current-mix behavior. ``run_pre`` accepts either an expanded
``[tokens, 4, hidden]`` residual with full ``fn[24, 4 * hidden]`` or the older
broadcast ``[tokens, hidden]`` residual with pre-summed ``fn[24, hidden]``.
Scratch ``split_k`` defaults to ``4 * hidden / 256`` (80 for hidden 5120).
Lagged mixing specializes the existing finalize; projection remains a separate
pass, not a single Mega-mHC kernel. Caller-owned paths support CUDA graphs,
not Dynamo tracing.

Planned lifecycle: ``plan(Caps(...))`` -> ``bind`` (views only) ->
``run_*`` (capture safe; torch.compile-safe via opaque custom ops).

Example:
    from b12x.norm import mhc

    plan    = mhc.plan(mhc.Caps(...))
    spec    = plan.scratch_specs()[0]
    scratch = torch.empty(spec.shape, dtype=spec.dtype, device=spec.device)
    binding = mhc.bind(plan, scratch=scratch, ...)
    residual, post, comb, y = mhc.run_post_pre(..., binding=binding)
