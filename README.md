# b12x

`b12x` is an SM120/SM121 CuTe DSL and Triton kernel library for local LLM inference.
It specifically targets DGX Spark, RTX Spark and the Blackwell-based RTX
cards (RTX 6000 Pro, RTX 5090).

It is *not* intended to be used in production/datacenter environments, both due to
architecture mismatches and the fast-moving pace of the library. For mission-critical
use cases please use FlashInfer, CUTLASS or TRTLLM.

## Install

```bash
pip install b12x
```

You need Python 3.10+, `torch >= 2.12`, and an SM120/SM121 GPU. The CuTe DSL
compiler and its CUDA 13 libraries come in as wheel dependencies
(`nvidia-cutlass-dsl == 4.6.2`), so there is no build step — kernels are
JIT-compiled on first use and cached.

## What's in here

Every kernel is one op at `b12x.<group>.<op>`; `list_ops()` enumerates the
complete set. The op owns its `plan`/`bind`/`run` facade in `api.py`; the
kernel guts sit in `_impl.py`/`_kernel*.py`; cross-op lowering lives in
`<group>/_shared/` and the universal compile/scratch spine in `b12x/_lib/`.

**`gemm`** — `gemm.blockscaled` is the common dense interface for raw
NVFP4/MXFP4/MXFP8/block-FP8 operands and packed MXFP8/tensor-FP8 weights; it
owns `mm`, `pack_weight`, and serving `prewarm`. The legacy
`gemm.mxfp8_linear` and `gemm.tensor_fp8_linear` imports are compatibility
aliases. `gemm.block_fp8_linear` retains a separate planned interface because
it owns caller-provided scratch and inline requantization. The fused MLA query
projection (`gemm.mla_query_projection`) and grouped WO projection
(`gemm.wo_projection`) are used around MLA attention.
`gemm.block_fp8_linear` also accepts V4.1's 32x32 E4M3/UE8M0 weight blocks
with per-32 activation quantization. `gemm.bf16_gemv.mm` handles unquantized
BF16/FP32 projections, including FP32 outputs and bias before final rounding;
live row counts share one compiled geometry/type specialization.


**`attention`** — `attention.paged` (paged-KV decode/extend, FP8 KV, MSA block
sparse, CUDA-graph-replayable), `attention.sparse_mla` and
`attention.compressed_sparse_mla` (top-k / compressed-page MLA — distinct
contracts, kept separate on purpose), `attention.dsa_indexer` (the DSA/MSA quantize →
score → select pipeline), `attention.qsa` (group-selected exact sparse GQA
decode over caller-populated, read-only main BF16 K/V), and `attention.varlen`
(contiguous batched/varlen).
The `deepseek_v41` compressed-MLA recipe uses distinct post-RoPE cache
records: 528-byte SWA rows (E4M3 plus per-32 UE8M0 scales) and 288-byte main
rows (E2M1 plus per-16 E4M3 scales, without a global scale).
`attention.mla_compress` produces normalized pre-RoPE latents for the
nonoverlapping ratio-1/ratio-2 compressor. The MXFP4 DSA recipe exposes a
score/reduce/select boundary and bounded candidate indices for hierarchical
reindexing; tensor-parallel score reduction precedes selection.


**`moe`** — `moe.fused_moe`, fused FP4 TP MoE across a micro-kernel decode
path, a unified dynamic path (persistent grid, `nvfp4`/`w4a8_mx`/`w4a8_nvfp4`),
and W4A16 (BF16 activations, inline FP4 weight dequant — no activation-scale
math), with SiLU/ReLU2/SwiGLU-OAI activations; plus `moe.ep_moe` (expert
parallel).

**the rest** — `norm.mhc` (fused RMSNorm + hyper-connection residual),
`norm.hyperconnection` (learned multi-stream residual primitives),
`sequence.{ple_hash,ple_embedding,ple}` (prime-hashed embedding IDs, fused
quantized lookup, and short-convolution state), `sequence.gdn_decode` (packed
recurrent decode), `sequence.gdn_prefill` (research-only scalar-gated prefill;
see [GDN prefill](docs/gdn-prefill.md)), `sequence.kda_prefill` (KDA prefill),
`sequence.mtp_feedback` (MTP token/multi-stream feedback fusion),
`quantization.{nvfp4,mxfp8}` (row quantizers), `comm.roce` (RoCEnante: one-shot
RDMA all-reduce/all-gather for multi-node DGX Spark TP, see `docs/rocenante.md`),
and `comm.pcie` (IPC-backed PCIe
collectives). The Qwen3.8-Flash-Next QSA, HyperConnection, PLE, GDN decode,
and MTP feedback Triton implementations are correctness references and are
not throughput-qualified production kernels.
`sequence.engram` implements V4.1's compressed-token, DEAD-bounded n-gram
hashing and row-sharded FP8/group-32 lookup. It is not an alias for Qwen PLE:
their tokenizer domains, boundary rules, scale layouts, and convolution state
differ. Engram's direct residual injection uses
`norm.hyperconnection.run_engram_mix`; ordinary affine RMSNorm is selected
with `zero_centered=False`. `norm.mhc.run_pre` and `run_post_pre` accept
incoming `pre_mix` and caller-owned `pre_out` for lagged V4.1 mixing, while
`run_collapse` supports the final weighted collapse and uniform stream mean.

PLE and Engram share the bounded io_uring row cache in
`sequence._shared.disk_table`: registered file regions, aligned O_DIRECT reads,
block deduplication/coalescing, mapped-host staging, and stream-safe reuse.
Their hashing and decoding stay separate. Engram's `DiskTable` reads the
checkpoint's FP8 weight rows and separate E8M0 scale rows without conversion or
full-table allocation; `run_lookup(..., token_count=...)` prepares fixed GPU
outputs outside `torch.compile` and CUDA graph capture. The V4.1 vLLM adapter
selects this path with `--engram-config '{"table_memory":"disk"}'` and prepares
both Engram layers before each target forward, including speculative
verification. DSpark's own draft/Markov graph has no Engram disk reads.

`sequence.embedding` provides exact unquantized BF16/FP32 row lookup into
caller-owned output, with Int32/Int64 IDs and Int64 table offsets. Its
`precompile` entrypoint warms width/type specializations before capture;
live row counts and table extents do not select compiler-cache entries.

The V4.1 serving adapter retains checkpoint-native BF16 weights and activations.
Model-required accumulation, normalization, routing scores, and ratio-two
softmax-pooling state remain FP32. Routed MoE contributions are reduced and
combined with the shared expert in FP32 before the final BF16 cast. Speculative
rejection preserves per-token compressor partials in request-owned bounded
rings rather than overwriting one terminal carry state.

The adapter binds mHC and sparse-attention/indexer plan scratch to vLLM's shared
workspace. Outputs remain separate, live-row-sized allocations rather than
per-layer scheduler-capacity buffers reserved during model construction.
The [startup verification record](validation/deepseek_v41/startup_workspace_fix.json)
covers the constructor-memory repair. The subsequent
[native KV allocation repair](validation/deepseek_v41/native_kv_allocation_fix.json)
aligns main KV and index K on the same logical token blocks, preserves their
packed 890-byte-per-token global footprint, and restores model-derived cache
grouping instead of the fork's bounded GLM grouping path. TP4 SSD serving now
initializes the full 1M context at a 4096-token batch capacity and 0.95 memory
utilization; the record distinguishes capacity accounting from exercised
prompt lengths and includes graph replay, rejection, and prefix-reuse checks.

The [structural optimization qualification](validation/deepseek_v41/structural_optimization.json)
records the subsequent prefill/decode work. Attention consumes a whole planned
query batch after bounded indexer chunks, rather than launching attention for
every 64 rows. Eager indexing bounds score/collective width by known visibility;
captured indexing retains fixed capacity with tiled clearing of inactive columns.
Lagged mHC uses native post-pre fusion except across Engram mutation. Dense
execution regimes are prewarmed, and DSpark context preparation uses bounded
graphs and KV-only checkpoint projections. SSD Engram uses prefix-bound hashing
and lookup, with initialization and retired-row clearing owned by its staging
buffer. The benchmarks retain distinct Engram/PLE quantization and hash contracts.

The [CED acceptance record](validation/deepseek_v41/ced_prefill.json) covers
full-row encoder execution and decoder global-KV preparation followed by
bounded decoder replay. Each long request chunk keeps its trailing 128 decoder
rows; short chunks continue the request's private SWA state. Decoder and draft
SWA are not published to prefix caching, and encoder/global prefix hits leave
at least 128 tokens to regenerate decoder state. Prompt-logprob requests retain
full decoder rows. Sampling keeps its original row ABI; DSpark projects only
the selected context rows. Replay is intentionally approximate, as described
in the model report, rather than identical to full-decoder prefill.

Engram also supports `ENGRAM_TABLE_MEMORY=ram` in the V4.1 launcher.
Its packed E4M3 weights and E8M0 scales live in b12x CUDA-mapped host RAM;
checkpoint loading writes only each TP shard directly into its final CPU
aliases. Native GPU lookup reads those allocations over PCIe, without SSD
transactions during generation. Both table owners remain alive through graph
replay. The full checkpoint uses 188.83 GiB of pinned host RAM across TP4.
The [RAM investigation record](validation/deepseek_v41/ram_engram.json) retains
successful shard/replay smoke checks but is marked unsafe after a later host OOM.
Use SSD storage while full-RAM peak memory remains unqualified.

`comm.pcie.PCIeDmaAllReduce.prepare_eager_replay(dtype, max_elements=...)`
prepares a lossless graph for a planned element bound. A larger FP32 workspace
does not inflate the BF16 replay size. Exact-capacity eager inputs use fixed
staging buffers; other supported sizes use raw DMA instead of transferring
padding. Outputs remain independent. All ranks prepare the same dtype bounds
before capture; compressed wire modes and outer captures keep their existing paths.

`b12x` owns planning, scratch layout, and policy, so serving stacks only supply
metadata and capacity limits.

## Using it

Every stateful kernel lives at `b12x.<group>.<op>` and shares the **same
shape** — `plan` the work, size scratch from the plan, `bind` your tensors as
views, `run`. The module path carries the context, so the verbs and role
classes (`Caps`/`Plan`/`Binding`) are uniform across families:

```python
# norm — fused RMSNorm + hyper-connection residual mixing
from b12x.norm import mhc

plan    = mhc.plan(mhc.Caps(...))
spec    = plan.scratch_specs()[0]
scratch = torch.empty(spec.shape, dtype=spec.dtype, device=spec.device)
binding = mhc.bind(plan, scratch=scratch, ...)
residual, post, comb, y = mhc.run_post_pre(..., binding=binding)
```

```python
# moe — fused tensor-parallel routed-expert FFN (weights prepped once per model)
from b12x.moe import fused_moe

wplan   = fused_moe.plan_weights(quant_modes="nvfp4",
                                 source_format="modelopt_nvfp4", ...)
experts = fused_moe.prepare_weights(plan=wplan, ...)
plan    = fused_moe.plan(fused_moe.Caps(...))
spec    = plan.scratch_specs()[0]
scratch = torch.empty(spec.shape, dtype=spec.dtype, device=spec.device)
binding = fused_moe.bind(plan, scratch=scratch, a=x, experts=experts,
                         topk_weights=tw, topk_ids=ti)
out     = fused_moe.run(binding=binding)
```

```python
# attention — sparse MLA from compressed KV pages (DeepSeek V4)
from b12x.attention import compressed_sparse_mla

plan    = compressed_sparse_mla.plan(compressed_sparse_mla.Caps(...))
spec    = plan.scratch_specs()[0]
scratch = torch.empty(spec.shape, dtype=spec.dtype, device=spec.device)
binding = compressed_sparse_mla.bind(plan, scratch=scratch, q=q,
                              swa_indices=idx, swa_lengths=lens, ...)
out = compressed_sparse_mla.run(swa_k_cache=swa, binding=binding, sm_scale=scale, ...)
```

`plan` is host-side and may allocate; `bind` only narrows/views (never
allocates), which is what makes captured graphs safe; `run*` executes and is
CUDA-graph-capture safe. One-shot ops (`gemm.blockscaled.mm`,
`quantization.mxfp8.quantize_rows`) are plain functions; `comm.pcie`
collectives are stateful classes. `b12x.list_ops()` enumerates the full
set; every op exports `is_supported()`. Underneath, kernels register as torch
custom ops in the private `b12x::` namespace (torch.compile / CUDA-graph
integration) — prefer the Python API.

## PCIe DMA wire modes

`PCIeDmaAllReduce` can compress eligible BF16 all-reduces. Configure it with
`B12X_PCIE_DMA_FP8`, or pass the same value as the `fp8=` constructor
argument. Integrations such as vLLM can forward their own launch setting to
that constructor.

| Mode | Reduce-scatter | All-gather | When to use it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0` | BF16 ring | BF16 ring | Unquantized baseline |
| `ag` | BF16 ring | block E4M3 ring | Limit E4M3 quantization to the final broadcast |
| `ring` | block E4M3 ring, requantized per hop | block E4M3 ring | Compress both phases with the neighbor ring |
| `a2a` | block E4M3 scatter with FP32 accumulation | block E4M3 broadcast | Quantize each input once and overlap direct peer transfers |
| `i8` | BF16 ring | block INT8 ring | Limit INT8 quantization to the final broadcast |
| `i8_ring` | block INT8 ring, requantized per hop | block INT8 ring | Compress both phases with the INT8 codec |
| `i8_a2a` | block INT8 scatter with FP32 accumulation | block INT8 broadcast | Use the quantize-once all-to-all topology with INT8 |
| `mx` | BF16 ring | MXFP8 ring | Limit MXFP8 quantization to the final broadcast |
| `mx_ring` | MXFP8 ring, requantized per hop | MXFP8 ring | Compress both phases with standard E4M3/E8M0 MXFP8 |
| `mx_a2a` | MXFP8 scatter with FP32 accumulation | MXFP8 broadcast | Use the quantize-once all-to-all topology with MXFP8 |

Every compressed mode uses 132 bytes per 128 values instead of 256 bytes for
BF16, a 48.4% wire-byte reduction. E4M3 and INT8 store one FP32 scale per 128
values; MXFP8 stores four E8M0 scales, one per 32 values. These modes are most
useful for large prefill collectives on PCIe-only multi-GPU systems where peer
transport is the bottleneck; they do not change the KV-cache format and usually
do not affect small decode collectives. Choose a codec by model quality gates,
then benchmark the ring and all-to-all variants on the target PCIe topology.

Compressed transport requires BF16 input and a per-rank shard divisible by
128 elements; other shapes use the BF16 path:

```bash
B12X_PCIE_DMA_FP8=i8_ring python -m your_server
```

Specializations follow static geometry, dtype, planned capacity and
device/toolchain identity, not live request counts. Before serving, precompile
the selected specializations and exercise their runtime paths, then freeze:

```python
import b12x

# ... preplan capacities and warm every selected specialization ...
b12x.freeze_kernel_resolution("serving")
```

After the freeze, any request that would trigger a new kernel compile raises
`KernelResolutionFrozenError` instead of stalling a live request (or worse,
compiling inside CUDA graph capture).

Set `B12X_PRINT_COMPILE_PROGRESS=1` to log each compiler invocation with its
cache-key parameters and duration — useful for figuring out what warmup
actually covered. `B12X_TIMING=1` enables per-kernel timing logs.

## Where to look next

- `tests/` is the executable spec — per-group API and numerical-reference
  tests showing exact tensor layouts and `plan`/`bind`/`run` call sequences.
  (`tests/_legacy/` holds the pre-namespace flat-API suite, being migrated.)
- `benchmarks/` has tuned invocations per kernel family (and `probe_*` scripts
  from tile-sweep experiments).
- `docs/` has design notes: the MoE execution model, the eager-plan-bind
  architecture, and an SM120 MLA postmortem.
- `validation/deepseek_v41/` retains the original qualification artifacts from
  the `Initial DSV41 bringup` backport (`674cacac5226baf8143327560040ce1e2e67fea5`).
  Its JSON/CSV records preserve migration-era paths and hashes as provenance;
  they do not qualify subsequent changes to this standalone tree.

Failing that, ask your friendly neighborhood AI agent — it does fine here.
